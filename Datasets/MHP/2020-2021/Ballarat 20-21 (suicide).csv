Even more smug that I can at least draw a correlation between the country's extremely high rate of paternal leave uptake, almost 50%&lt; Male suicide rate, world renowned educational outcomes &amp; present, involved &amp; respected fathers!!❤❤❤❤",MichaelJRay4
Ballarat,2021-01-15 09:39:29+00:00,1350014732778962946,"@cuhlarerichards @JaneCaro @elyasgarad Any chance that the 7 men per day who suicide or 60,000 plus men that attempt suicide each year might also need mental health help lest they lash out at those who are trying to support them in their anguish and suffering? Until we address mens mental health DV will continue",MichaelJRay4
Ballarat,2021-01-12 02:05:21+00:00,1348813283675963394,@ColeenMacK_AUS @zacseidler There's anecdotal data that shows more gender equitable cultures such as the Nordic countries have a lower Male suicide rate and better mental health outcomes. Not sure if there's been any causality linked,MichaelJRay4

Ballarat,2021-01-06 02:23:08+00:00,1346643434329702400,"@selfunded @snootswoon I’ve reported this tweet and account for encouraging self harm or suicide. 

If you see this comment please do the same

Snooty, please take no notice, you are a wonderful Tweep, you don’t deserve this, neither does anyone
Much love EBK💜",EmergencyBK
Ballarat,2021-01-01 00:57:26+00:00,1344809925873004545,@DanielCarlson_1 The Nordic countries with more gender equitable societies seem to have better mental health outcomes for men with approximately 1/2 the suicide rate of Australia which still suffers from outdated gender expectations,MichaelJRay4
Ballarat,2020-12-27 06:30:58+00:00,1343081922033930241,"@Pleasure_Lab I'm still confounded that we can't draw at least a correlation between men's mental health &amp; DV. 7 men per day suicide, &gt;60,000 attempts per year. How many lash out in their anguish &amp; suffering. We would well protect women by helping men imo",MichaelJRay4
Ballarat,2020-12-13 09:43:54+00:00,1338057046701166597,"@dadbloguk Sadly men seem to have become disposable John. We're losing 7 men per day in Australia to suicide with an estimated 60,000 + attempts per year. If 7 whales washed up on Bondi beach each day the outcry would be deafening! How much DV is connected to this mental health plague?",MichaelJRay4

1. Not about 1 article.
2. About extra layers of abuse &amp; degradation women face, on top of the norm. 
3. First tweet on ur page about suicide -think needless abuse &amp; stress contribute to this?
Check your privilege &amp; hypocrisy",EmergencyBK

ExAFL player, 30’s sadly took his life this wk, most media only reported his ‘passing’ &amp; great career- ignored suicide. 
Sadly media nor gov. will report on/or address issue any time soon😔",EmergencyBK
