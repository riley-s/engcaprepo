Sunshine Coast,2020-02-01 01:34:05+00:00,1223419213563326465,Of course it doesn‚Äôt stack up. Over a million Australians experience depression every year. Over 2 million other mood disorders yet less than 1 in 1000 die by #suicide. It is a common risk factor but it is life events that largely cascade a person to #suicide. https://t.co/2GS9MbRcus,johno0910
