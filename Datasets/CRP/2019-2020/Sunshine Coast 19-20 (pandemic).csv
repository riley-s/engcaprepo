But since then just bullshit spin, which of course media flogs every single time ARGH!",YaThinkN
Sunshine Coast,2020-03-10 19:13:12+00:00,1237456488618004481,"This is not good enough.

Seriously, another day another lead news item on the ABC giving Australians the impression that the government is addressing this pandemic.

NOTHING CONCRETE that will operationally assist Australians has happened at all. Nothing!",YaThinkN
Sunshine Coast,2020-03-10 19:10:13+00:00,1237455736889683968,"Each plan of course leaked to media to sound good, sounds like Government is doing something about this pandemic. In reality have done sweet frack all, except of course get a shitload of media to promote the spin they are ""going to..."" do something.

No wonder there is panic.",YaThinkN

Saturation messaging everyday on status of pandemic, actions for people to follow. Twice daily briefs to every general practice ... where is this?? @Bowenchris @GregHuntMP @David_Speers @SabraLane",johno0910

Organisation, infra, healthcare good enough to stop in US but econ impact of millions sick globally would be huge. Worst case it doesnt just kill the old/weak but also healthy ppl. Then BIG prob!",thomsoash
