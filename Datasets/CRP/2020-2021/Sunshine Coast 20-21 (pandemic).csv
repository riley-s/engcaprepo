Sunshine Coast,2020-03-14 06:20:23+00:00,1238711557011324929,@iMusing @merryboffin The game mate. Always the game. Vast majority of press gallety just can't view politics and policy with any semblance of reality. Always through prism of game of politics and it is bad at the best of times. Is downright dangerous in a pandemic 😞,YaThinkN
